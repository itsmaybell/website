   				 <h2>I'm Maybell Villanueva</h2>
   				 <p>I'm currently living in Zone2 Danao Jasaan Misamis Oriental, I'm 21 years old. I'm studying now in USTP Jasaan 2nd year college with the course of Information Technology. My hobby is to watch kdrama scrolling in tiktok and playing with my niece and I loved singing and dancing. I have two sisters and three brothers. When i was 2months old baby my father decided to give me to his sister because my five siblings is deaf. when i was in grade-1 i found out that i am adopted, if my father did not give me to his sister maybe i can't talk and hear now. I am so blessed and thankful even though i have that a lot of problems in life even though that i was thinking to kill myself becasue of the struggles that im facing but now im still here fighting for my self and also for my dreams. I know to myself that i am not smart and my family is poor, So i want to continue achieving my dreams because i want to give them the life that they deserve.I'm praying for more blessing and i hope that i can endure this college life, and ofcourse i want to thank god for guiding me always, and to my family and love ones. That's all i need to share about me/my life, Thankyou!!! </p>
